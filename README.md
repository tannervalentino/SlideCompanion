# SlideCompanion
A Runelite alternative for iPad OSRS users.
This project is an idea I had that would benefit me if not others. The roadblock was that i have no more than elementary knowledge of html/css or really any coding for that matter. My solution: try to build the entire project with the help of ChatGPT. Due to actively testing with GitHub Pages as my only means of executing HTML (all done on my iPad) there will be an absurd amount of commits. Beware.
